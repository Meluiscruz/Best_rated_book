# Python Challenge : Find the most rated books on the cvs file.

## Objective.

At the next Dataset:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WUG9a-oCrMQ0g21kVmpfoGmwRQSdQFzC

What is the book with the best rating?

## Background.

I used Jupyter Notebook to build an Statistic analysis to determinate what is the best rated book (taking into account all the useful data from the given csv file). The first issue of this Notebook has comments in 'Spanglish'.

This repo has the following files:

- books_parsing.py : The first (and failed) approach to solve this problem.
- books. csv : The source of data.
- Most_Rated_Books_(ES).ipynb : The Jupyter Notebook that I show what is the best rated book (with facts and logic!)
- Most_Rated_Books_(ES).pdf : In case you do not have Anaconda

## Notes.
